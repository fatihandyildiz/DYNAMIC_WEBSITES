# DYNAMIC_WEBSITES
As Github hosts only static websites, I use Heroku to host my dynamic websites. You can find the links to my projects inside README file.

Here are some of my projects:

A journal with add/delete posts functionalities. Connected to MongoDB Atlas Database:

https://bidik-journal.herokuapp.com

A to-do list. Connected to MongoDB Atlas Database:

Display weather of any city you choose. I use an api to get weather data from openweathermap.com. User interface still needs some work:
